This repository contains the .NET port source code for the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing ([NuPIC](http://numenta.org/nupic.html)). It will eventually contain all algorithms for NuPIC, but is currently in a transition period. For details on building NuPIC within the python environment, please see http://github.com/numenta/nupic.
